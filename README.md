# spectralsimulationstudy
This is a Jupyter notebook for a lesson in 2D spectral signal simulation. The first part provides a practical example of simulating signals in Fourier basis, the bonus part explains practically all the basics one might need: 1D signals and their Fourier transforms, energy spectral density (ESD), adding noise to signals, generating random signals on the basis of an ESD both with the help of shaping filters and by spectral simulation.
A powerpoint for a related lecture is added that uses the basics and puts them in a coherent story.
